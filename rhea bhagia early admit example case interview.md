foreign thank you for coming in today we're very excited to have you my name is Ziad and I will be your interviewer today awesome great I'm super excited to be here I am Maria vagyan awesome so um do you want to just dive straight into the case yeah I'm ready whenever you are okay let's do it so for today's case you actually have a maker of Botox that is considering expanding into the migraine Market and they've already begun clinical trials in this area the product is expected to receive FDA approval at the end of the year and your team has been hired to assess the viability of the product launch so essentially the question is how would you determine if Botox company should enter the migraine Market okay awesome thank you for sharing that information so just before I get started I want to make sure I correctly correct client here is Botox and they are considering expanding into the migraine market and the product they're working with is going through the trial process now waiting for FDA approval and our main goal here is to figure out whether or not it's viable or not to enter the migraine Market that's correct okay awesome so before we get started just wanted a little bit more information about the product to know exactly what it looks like sure um so what I know is that the product is basically an injection that is given every two months and it offers similar efficacy to other like Market options without any side effects and as a benefit it does have some like skin care benefits to it so okay awesome as a person who loves skin care that's amazing I feel like that's all the information I need so is it okay if I take a couple moments to brainstorm my thoughts absolutely awesome thank you okay great so after looking at the situation at hand in order to figure out whether or not Botox should enter the migraine Market there's three main factors I'm thinking about the migraine Market financial implications and just overall risks so under the migraine Market I think it would be really beneficial to understand what the size of the migraine Market looks like and what consumer demand is also diving into how fast it's growing if it's stagnant shrinking just like the overall market growth and then I think it'd be really beneficial to understand what other treatments are out there and what potential competition would look like to see what botox's market share could be so second diving into the financial implications there's kind of two sides I think would be helpful the revenues and costs so under revenues um I think it would be great to understand what the competitors are pricing injections for to determine how Botox should price it it'd be also helpful to understand what our customers elasticity is and their willingness to pay to figure out a good price and then doing a little bit more analysis into what number of units sold could look like and how can a police cannibalization of other Botox products would affect this law and then on the cost side it would be helpful to understand what initial Investments would be needed looking at the research and development maybe potential clinical trial costs and then what ongoing costs there may be for this injection and third the risks I see two main areas within the risks a logistical aspect and then more regulatory so in the logistics I think something to keep note of is figuring out whether or not Botox has the capabilities to add additional supply chain distribution centers or production facilities um maybe diving a little bit into what our administrative or Workforce expertise and skills look like to see if it's capable for us to launch such a big product and then lastly under logistical risks kind of figuring out if this injection matches with botox's Mission and portfolio of their other products and then lastly under regulation risks you had mentioned that we're in the clinical trial process looking for FDA approval so diving into what the barriers to entry would be looking at specifically the FDA approval maybe if any patents are needed what progressing clinical trials look like so after assessing the overall migraine Market financial implications and risks I think we would have a good understanding if this is a viable entry or not but looking at it I think it'd be beneficial to start off with the market as a whole and see if that's attractive or not does that sound good yeah let's do that actually that I think that's a good place to start maybe we can go by how big do you think this Market is in the first place okay perfect so just to make sure you want me to Market size the overall botox injection Market is that specifically for the US that's correct just the US okay perfect is it okay if I take a couple moments to brainstorm my thoughts absolutely awesome okay perfect so the way that that I think about this is to estimate the size of the botox injection Market we should start off with the overall U.S population then dive into the percentage of people who suffer from headaches and then the percentage of people who have headaches that are bad enough that they would need these injections then by doing those calculations we can get the total size of like the total number of patients that we'd be working with and then from there I'm thinking I could estimate the number of injections per patient and put a price tag to that to figure out the overall Market size for injections and then we're looking specifically at botox's share so then applying what our potential market share would look like to get the overall Botox Market size for injections does that sound like a good process yeah no that's a good approach okay awesome so I'm just going to take a moment to put the math to that okay awesome so if we start off with the US population of 320 million I would say about thinking from personal experience of my friends like one in every five I feel like get headaches so we could say about 20 of people suffer from headaches and then out of those that 20 I'd say like one in four people have headaches that are so bad that they would need some sort of migraine injection treatment so let's take 25 of that so 20 of 320 million is 64 million and then a fourth of 64 million is going to be 16 million so that's the number of patients that may be needing an injection next I'm going to think about like how many injections a patient would need I think you would mention that these injections are needed every two months so a patient would need it six times a year and then next I want to think about what a potential price would be so I personally have not had any Botox I'm only 21 but I'm thinking that it ranges quite a bit from very cheap options to more expensive off the gun I think about 200 is pretty fair price tag to put on it I think so that's a good price okay great so I'll take the 16 million number of patients times six injections a year times two hundred dollars per injection and I'll just take a moment to crank out that math really quickly 16 times 6 is 96 times 200 is going to be 19.2 billion dollars so I'm getting 19.2 billion dollars for the total Market but we're looking specifically at Botox Botox I know has like a really big name they're a well-known company so I'm assuming they have a pretty high market share I think around 30 is a good bet does that sound like a good number I would say so yeah okay great so I'm going to take 30 and is it okay if I round that 9.2 billion to 19 billion sure okay great so 30 of 19 billion is going to be I know 19 times 3 is 57 so 30 of 19 will be 5.7 billion so I'm getting a total number of 5.7 billion dollars for the U.S botox injection Market great so looking at that number I'm trying to figure out whether or not it's attractive or not it seems like a pretty big number but I think to really determine if the market is attractive or not we could look at what potential growth looks like or what the competitive landscape is do we have any information about either of those yeah so we have some information about it we know that when it comes to market growth we expect the market to remain somewhat stagnant so no growth nor is there a decline and then when it comes to the competitive landscape we actually don't expect there to be a lot of competitors so we think that it's kind of not a very competitive market to go into so we don't expect any like Fierce competition of some sorts okay perfect so knowing that the market is pretty stagnant pretty large at 5.7 billion and not too saturated it looks like the market as a whole is pretty attractive but I think I would still like to discuss a little bit more and dive into maybe the financial implications or potential risks do we have any information about maybe financial implications yeah so we actually think that the financial the financial side would probably be like looking good based off of like the 5.7 billion estimate that you have I'm actually more interested in looking at the risks could you maybe brainstorm a few ideas or potential risks that the botox company could be facing when they enter the migraine Market yeah course is it okay if I take a couple moments to think about that one absolutely okay okay great so I'm thinking there's three main causes of concern our client should think about before entering the botox market and that comes with branding cannibalization and patient concerns so first under branding I'm thinking even if they use the same name as Botox or a different name and different brand there's risks to both sides if our client was supposed to use the botox name keep that same name I know that Botox has a very specific connotation to it that it's cosmetic kind of controversial sometimes but we're not servicing a cosmetic product so it might turn some patients away because ours is a migraine injection not a cosmetic injection but then if we were to use a different name there's the possibility if there being a lack of Market traction because you have to redo all the marketing and branding since Botox already has a big name so if you were to use a different one A little bit harder to get some traction there so is The Branding side next we look under cannibalization so Botox already has some pre-existing products of course they have some injections like lip injections I think so I'm thinking that if we're launching a new product at a pretty similar price range maybe lower it might cannibalize some of botox's pre-existing products stock is a concern to look at but I'm thinking that if we do a little bit more investigation into the regulatory process or other mechanisms to kind of keep the market separate that could be a potential mitigation to it and then lastly is the patient concerns I'm thinking that with patient concerns I know that I personally am very scared of shots so there may be other patients out there that are a little bit adverse to injectable therapies especially when there might be oral remedies like other like Tylenol or Advil or other things that they could take to get rid of their migraine another patient concern to think about is that they the injection is still being approved by the FDA right so they may be a little bit averse to using a product that has just been approved and may be looking to see more research or more trials in the future and then the last concern with patients is that insurance companies may not necessarily pay for the botox injection so we may have to look a little bit more with insurance companies to make sure that this is something that they will put onto their plan awesome um all sounds like good risks to take into account so CEO of the company walks in and wants a 30 second recommendation what do you say awesome um yeah I would say this sounds like a very viable opportunity it seems like the market is very attractive we did calculations and saw that the market is about 5.7 billion dollars that Botox could tap into which seems very attractive since the market is stagnant it's not super saturated just as a potential risk though since we're still in the clinical trials and FDA process it's very dependent on making it past that so just continuing to do the clinical trials working with insurance companies to make sure it can get on the plan and marketing the product in a way that alleviates patient concerns for like using the product in the future I feel like are the best ways to go but yeah overall it seems like a great opportunity awesome well thank you so much for the time
